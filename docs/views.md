# Views

Views can do everything Models can do, as well as:

1. Abstracts away some common complications about the timing and context of
   [rendering views](#Rendering).
2. Provides / updates some [basic statistics](#Drawing_statistics) that are
   commonly used in designing custom visual interfaces

# Setting up views

Like `Model`, the `View` is designed to be overridden with your custom code. For
views, you should override and implement `setup` and/or `draw` functions (which
should feel sort of familiar to [Processing](https://processing.org/) fans).
Typically, you won't call these functions directly (though we won't try to stop
you if you need to); instead, you will call the view's `render()` function to
tell it to initialize or update itself.

`render()` ensures that all needed resources have loaded, and that a DOM element
has been uniquely assigned to the `View`, before attempting `setup()` and
`draw()`. It also catches errors and redirects to `setupError()` and
`drawError()` to facilitate more informative interfaces.

## Creating views

To instantiate a view, you need to give it a d3-selected DOM element _at some
point_, that will be available to `setup` and `draw` calls as `this.d3el`. You
can do this during initialization, or as an argument to any subsequent
`render()` call. For example:

```javascript
class MyView extends uki.View {
  async setup() {
    this.d3el.html("<p>Called setup, but not draw yet...</p>");
  }
  async draw() {
    this.d3el.append("p").text("...just called draw!");
  }
}

const view1 = new MyView({ d3el: d3.select("#view1") });
const view2 = new MyView();

view1.render();
view2.render();

// At this point, view1's setup() and draw() will be colled, but view2 is
// waiting for a DOM element

view2.render(d3.select("#view2"));
// Now view2's setup() and draw() will be called
```

## Rendering

Exactly when / how / how often you call `render` is up to you. In general, you
shouldn't need to worry about doing it too often (even if your `draw()` function
is somewhat expensive), as `setup()` is only called once, and `draw()` will be
debouncedâ€”meaning that you can call `render()` as much as you like without
significantly affecting performance:

```javascript
class MyView extends uki.View {
  async setup() {
    // Set up a listener that will likely fire rapidly when the user interacts
    this.d3el.on("scroll", () => {
      this.render();
    });
  }
  async draw() {
    // Expensive draw() command only gets called when the user FINISHES scrolling
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      this.d3el.append("p").text(i);
    }
  }
}
```

`render()` also returns a Promise that resolves when `setup()` and `draw()` have
both finally completed.

A common pattern for larger apps is to listen to specific model changes, and
update when those changes are relevant, e.g.:

```javascript
class MyModel extends Model() {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.value = "Original Value";
  }
  externalUpdate(newValue) {
    this.value = newValue;
    this.trigger("update");
  }
}

class MyView extends View() {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);

    this.sharedState = options.sharedState;
    this.sharedState.on("update", () => {
      this.render();
    });
  }
  draw() {
    this.d3el.text(this.sharedState);
  }
}

const state = new MyModel();
const view = new MyView({
  d3el: d3.select("#view"),
  sharedState: state,
});

// view will show "Original Value"

state.externalUpdate("New Value");
// view will update itself to show "New Value" after this call
```

## Setup functions

`setup` functions are designed for cases where you want to initially create some
DOM scaffolding, or initialize things like scales that don't change. Basically,
anything that should only happen once should probably go in `setup`.

`setup` will be called immediately, and _exactly once_, after these three
conditions are met (in any order):

- Any [resources](./models.md#Importing_resources) the view has requested have
  finished loading
- The view has been [assigned a DOM element](#Creating_views)
- [render](#Rendering) has been called at least once

If, for some reason, you need `setup` to be called again, you can override the
view's `setupFinished` flag to `false`:

```javascript
myView.setupFinished = true;
myView.render();
```

Also, if you ever replace the assigned DOM element, `setup` will be called
again:

```javascript
myView.render(d3.select("#view1"));
// If this is the first time myView has rendered to #view1, setup() will be called

myView.render(d3.select("#view2"));
// setup() will be called again on the new element. Note that at this point,
// myView will only render to #view2, and ignore #view1
```

## Draw functions

`draw()` is where the meat of your d3 code should go, and a good habit is to use
d3 `update` selections here as much as possible to avoid the classic `enter` vs
`update` bugs that new d3 developers frequently encounter.

In the event that you want to fine-tune the rate at which `draw()` is debounced,
you can tweak the `debounceWait` property of a view:

```javascript
class MyView extends View {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
    this.debounceWait = 10000; // wait for 10 sec instead of the default 0.1 sec
  }
}

const view = new MyView({ d3el: d3.select("#view") });
view.render();
// Do something expensive here that lasts less than 10 seconds
view.render();
// There should only be one call to draw()
```

# Drawing sizes

For visual design, some dimensions are often inconsistent across browsers and
operating systems. For convenience, the following statistics are computed before
each `setup` call:

- `view.emSize`: the size of an EM in pixels
- `view.scrollBarSize`: the size of a scrollbar in pixels
